# Student Success App

We were tasked with the creation of application that would assist students with tracking their schedule of classes, taking notes 
and a todo list of things a student might want to track. We decided to develop the app utilizing the Ionic framework and creating a 
mobile native app for iOS and Android. Our initial goals were to launch the mobile app and the desktop web app together, but that didn't
happen.
